     SISTER ACT

     FADE IN:

     INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM
     We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late 
     Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little 
     desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; 
     she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are 
     all terrified of her.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes?

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER

     A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises 
     her hand.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine?

                               CHRISTINE
               Sister, may I be excused?

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine...

                               CHRISTINE
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

     Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine 
     stands and heads for the door.

     
                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. GIRLS ROOM

     Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. 
     She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has 
     taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it 
     out.  She applies lipstick.

     Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a 
     stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She 
     unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.  
     She sprays herself with dime store cologne.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. HALLWAY

     Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.  
     No one is around; she saunters down the hall.

     Page 2.

     ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
     Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. 
     There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for 
     her inside.

                               CHRISTINE
               Hi, Jimmy.

     Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door 
     behind her.

     ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA

     Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her 
     eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She 
     flings open the broom closet door,

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY

     in the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with 
     lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has 
     clearly been making out.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
                             (outraged)
               Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't 
               you know what happens to girls like you?  
               Don't you know what they become?

     INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED 
     POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)

     Taped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a 
     glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth-
     rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or 
     down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.

     The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere.

     We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in 
     the dark.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.  
               It was great.  Like usual.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               It was twenty minutes.  Like usual.

     Page 3.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               The best.

     VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is 
     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

                               VINCE
                             (half to Christy, half 
                             to the mirror)
               You are something else.

     Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.

                               CHRISTY
               Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can 
               talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, 
               we'll have fun.  And you still haven't 
               told me what happened.  What did she say?

                               VINCE
               What did who say?

                               CHRISTY
               Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.

     Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.

                               VINCE
               You are so damn sexy.

                               CHRISTY
               Vince...

                               VINCE
               How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, 
               five years we've been together?  Who do I 
               thank?

                               CHRISTY
                             (not buying it)
               Today was the deadline, Vince.

     Vince sits on the bed.  He takes Christy's hand, and 
     kisses it.

                               VINCE
               I want us to be together.  Like people.  
               Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of 
               God.  Babe, today... I went to 
               confession.

                               CHRISTY
               You did what?

     Page 4.

                               VINCE
               For the first time in I don't know how 
               long.  I wanted everything done right. 
               Open and above board.  I told Father 
               Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it 
               was a special love, for all the ages.

                               CHRISTY
                             (starting to fall for 
                             it)
               You said that?  And what did he say?  
               Did he say you could leave her?  Did he 
               say we'd be happy?

                               VINCE
                             (looking deep into her 
                             eyes)
               He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn 
               in Hell.  For all eternity.

     Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away 
     and starts putting on his shoes.

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (outraged)

                               VINCE
               You want me to go against a priest?  Get 
               excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

                               CHRISTY
               You bastard!

                               VINCE
                             (trying to calm her)
               We can still see each other.  Just like 
               always.  It's a different kind of sin. 
               Smaller.

                               CHRISTY
               You pig!

     Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.

                               VINCE
               Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's 
               God!

                               CHRISTY
               You lying sleazeball!  The best years of 
               my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

     Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it 
     smashes against the wall.

                               VINCE
               You're upset.  I understand.  I should 
               go.  I hate to.

     Page 5.

     A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.

                               CHRISTY
               Get out of here!  And never come back!

     A LAMP hits the wall, as Vince dodges it.  He makes a 
     phone gesture with his hand.

                               VINCE
               I'll call.

     Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. 
     He leaves.

     Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a 
     particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.  
     With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed 
     animal. She is caught between tears and rage.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

     ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden 
     Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc.  Scrunched in 
     between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT 
     HOTEL AND CASINO.  The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's 
     just seen better days.

     INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

     A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  The 
     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an 
     Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks 
     and style.

                               ELVIS
               Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Are 
               you lonesome tonight?  Welcome to the 
               Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible 
               Platinum Oldies Spectacular.

     Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's 
     eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back-
     up singers.

                               MICHELLE
               But you can't quit.  What'll happen to 
               us?
                             (to Tina)
               Tell her she can't quit.

                               TINA
               I told her.  She stuck pantyhose in my 
               mouth.

     Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the 
     Ronelles are ready.

     Page 6.

                               ELVIS
               Please welcome our own girl group 
               extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
               the fabulous Ronelles!

     Elvis disappears.  The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a 
     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style 
     gown.  Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs.  The 
     band begins a doo-wop vamp.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, girls.

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               This prom is a real drag.

                               RONELLES
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my!
                             (gasping)

                               RONELLES
               What is it, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               Look at that.  Get a gander.

                               RONELLES
               Oh my!
                             (sighing)

                               CHRISTY
               He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek 
               god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's 
               boss.  He's fab.  He's...

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
                             (singing)
               HE'S SO FINE.

                               RONELLES
               D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.

                               CHRISTY
               WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY 
               OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.

     As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style.

     Page 7.

     A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.

     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few 
     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE 
     LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives 
     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.

     INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel 
               with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either 
               married, a cop, or a lush from Des 
               Moines.

                               MICHELLE
               But what about us?

                               TINA
               You taught us the act.  The songs, all 
               the moves.

                               CHRISTY
               And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in 
               this rathole!  You're holding me back, 
               just like Vince!  I should be headlining!

     A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and 
     leans into the room.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you want?  This is a private 
               area!  Get lost!

                               JOEY
               You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.

                               CHRISTY
               Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit 
               the road.

     Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near Christy.

                               JOEY
               From Vince.

     Page 8.

                               CHRISTY
               His ashes?

                               JOEY
               With love.

     Joey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very 
     excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.

                               MICHELLE
               From Vince! With love!

                               TINA
               Michelle and Tina can't restrain 
               themselves: they open the box.  Inside is 
               a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and 
               Tina are impressed.

                               MICHELLE
               It's a fur!

                               TINA
               It's new!

                               CHRISTY
               It's a bribe.  Five years of my 
               goddamned life!

                               MICHELLE
               So you earned it!

                               TINA
               Vince owns the casino!  Cash in

                               CHRISTY
               I should throw this in his facet

     There's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it.  
     Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here?
                             (to heaven)
               Why me?  Whose dog did I kill?

                               MICHELLE
               Hi, Lieutenant.

                               TINA
               Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie picks up the coat.

                               EDDIE
               From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo-
               lang.

                               CHRISTY
               At least he's not a cop.  At least he 
               can afford a decent gift.

                               EDDIE
               I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your 
               birthday .  When we were seeing each 
               other.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, 
               that your mother picked out?  Lottery 
               tickets?  A travel iron?

                               EDDIE
               So I don't shop.

                               CHRISTY
               'Cause you're always out, arresting 
               people.  Making trouble.  I don't know 
               why I went out with you in the first 
               place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't 
               hold my head up, I used to tell people 
               you were a security guard!

                               EDDIE
               Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt?  
               You were singing in bowling alleys back 
               then.  I told people you were a hooker!

                               MICHELLE
               Calm down, you two.  It's always like 
               this.

                               EDDIE
               Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' 
               better class of people.  Vince Laflocca.

                               CHRISTY
               He's a businessman.

                               EDDIE
               A what? When are you qonna wake up?

                               CHRISTY
               When are you gonna get off my case?  
               Have you got a search warrant?  What do 
               you want -- cheap thrills?

                               EDDIE
               Information, baby.  I thought maybe 
               somebody around here might have a 
               conscience.

                               CHRISTY
               Think again!  And get out of here.

     Page 10.

                               EDDIE
               I'm going.  My regards to Vince,   And 
               the Mrs.

     Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head.  He 
     ducks, and the jar hits the door.

                               EDDIE
               Ladies.

     Eddie leaves.  Christy is standing, absolutely furious.

                               CHRISTY
               That's it!  I'm not taking it from him, 
               and I'm not taking it from Vince!  From 
               now on, it's all about me!  And if I 
               can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with 
               it -- it's gone.  Like Sister Immaculata 
               used to say, "Life is short, and then you 
               fry."  So long, girls -- see you in 
               church!

     Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     ERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from 
     Vince.  The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating 
     bullets.  The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a 
     brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension.

                               VINCE
               Ernie Schmidt.  How long you been with 
               us, Ernie Schmidt?

                               ERNIE
               Three years, Mr. LaRocca.  One behind 
               the bar, two as croupier.

     Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.

                               VINCE
               Ernie, you know what's important to me?  
               What counts?  It's not all this.  This is 
               '-- what?  Frosting.  Loyalty.  That's me, 
               Ernie.  That's home.

     Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and 
     points it at Ernie's head.

                               VINCE
               You ain't been loyal, Ernie.  What did 
               you tell the cops?

     Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer 
     to his temple.

     Page 11.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY

     Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator.  It 
     arrives; she gets in.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     The interrogation continues.

                               ERNIE
               I didn't tell the cops anything. I 
               swear.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

     Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of 
     office cubicles with half-wall partitions.  The floor is 
     deserted and dark as she makes her way through the 
     cubicles.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the 
     hair.

                               VINCE
               Who else, Ernie?  Who else was in on it?

                               ERNIE
                             (moaning)
               No one...

                               VINCE
                             (dropping Ernie's head 
                             in disgust)
               Why am I wasting my time?

     INT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

     Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor 
     to an executive suite.  She tries the knob, but finds the 
     door locked.  Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices.  She 
     tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.

                               CHRISTY
               Won't need that anymore.  Ta-ta.

     Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders 
     and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the 
     doorknob.  She pauses for a second, and then doubles her 
     resolve.

     Page 12.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

                               VINCE
               Do it.
                             (to Joey)

     ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens.  Christy 
     appears, with the mink coat in her arms.

                               CHRISTY
               Stuff this up your...

     A GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S.  Christy's eyes widen, and her 
     jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.

     ANGLE on the office.  Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. 
     Joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  Joey, Willy 
     and Vince stare at Christy.

                               VINCE
               Babe.
                             (icy calm)

     Christy tries to speak; she can't.

                               VINCE
               Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the 
               coat?

     Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She 
     quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear 
     matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.

                               CHRISTY
               No... it's fine. 

                               VINCE
               Yes?

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  A lot.

                               VINCE
               Is that why you came up here, Christy? 
               To thank me?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.

                               VINCE
               And to say you're sorry.  About this 
               afternoon.  And the things you said. 
               Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you 
               understand?  Forgotten.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching the subtext)
               Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

     Page 13.

     Vince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in 
     his, and kisses them.

                               VINCE
               That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will 
               you be home?  Soon?

     Christy kisses Vince, quickly.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  I'll be... at the apartment.  
               Call me.  Thanks.  Again.

     Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the 
     door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door.

                               CHRISTY
               Mink.  Wow.

     Christy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is 
     gone.

                               JOEY
               Vince -- is she... okay?

                               VINCE
               Maybe.
                             (considering this)

                               WILLY
               I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind 
               of upset.

                               VINCE
               She did.
                             (making a decision)
               Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

                               JOEY 
               And if she runs? 

                               VINCE
                             (icy)
               Take care of it.

     With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA

     Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from 
     Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which 
     leads to the cubicle area.

     LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened 
     maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the 
     cubicle area.

                               JOEY
               Christy?  He only wants to talk to you!

     Page 14.

     ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is 
     clutching the coat.

                               WILLY
               Christy?

     There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to 
     the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to 
     pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.

                               JOEY
               Christy?

     Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She 
     hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end 
     of the room.

     ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.

     Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat 
     explodes.

                               JOEY
               Come on, Christy!  There's no place to 
               go!

     Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She 
     accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and 
     starts HUMMING.

     ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly 
     moves toward the SOUND.

     Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He 
     starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on 
     casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; 
     the chair hits Willy and he falls.

     Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, 
     struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy 
     SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.

     Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been 
     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to 
     close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her 
     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches 
     for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.

     Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs 
     into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the 
     door.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, 
     still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A 
     BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and 
     steps.

     Page 15.

     At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into 
     a corridor.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past 
     doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink.  Joey 
     appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a 
     supply room.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a 
     pile of dirty linen.  Joey opens the door just as Christy 
     dives head first into the laundry chute.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like 
     a subway train through a tunnel.

     INT. BASEMENT

     The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin 
     of dirty linen.  Two workers glance around as they load 
     large washing machines with laundry.  Christy climbs out of 
     the bin and dashes for a door.  Working in a hotel, the 
     workers have seen everything.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Joey flies through the chute.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Joey suddenly flies into the bin.  He climbs out with his 
     gun in sight.

                               JOEY
               Which way?

     The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the 
     room.  One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.  He 
     looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have 
     swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of 
     the station's main floor.

     Page 16.

     Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two 
     other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.

                               CHRISTY
               Right between the eyes!  Down and out! 
               The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't 
               believe it!

                               EDDIE
               You couldn't believe it?  Vince the 
               Prince?

                               CHRISTY
               I never said he was an altar boy, okay?  
               But he sent his goons after me!  They 
               tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!

                               CLARKSON
               Tough break.  Whoa.

                               EDDIE
               What did you expect?  Vince is as dirty 
               as they come.  We've been finding bodies 
               around here for years.

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know anything about bodies!  I 
               mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was 
               good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. 
               He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to 
               go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let 
               me sing.

                               EDDIE
               He didn't do you a favor.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw you!

                               TATE
               Come on, she'll sing great.  When she 
               sings for us.

                               CHRISTY
               Sing -- like testify?  Are you nuts?  I 
               just want you to protect me!  You're 
               cops!

               Busy cops.  We don't have time to be 
               bodyguards for anyone who comes in here 
               with some cockamamie story.  Mink coats 
               and laundry chutes.

               What is this, some squeeze play?  Can't 
               you just protect me without any strings?

     The three detectives move in closer now and really apply 
     the pressure.

                               EDDIE
               We could put you into our witness 
               protection program.

               A hiding place.

               A new identity.

                               EDDIE
               But you'd have to agree to testify.  The 
               whole nine yards.

                               CHRISTY
               And if I don't?

                               EDDIE
               Then-you run.

               You wait.

               You listen for the footsteps.

                               EDDIE
               Then one day they find you.

               They open a window.

                               CLARKSON
               It's ten flights up.

                               TATE
               Ten flights down.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten flights?

                               EDDIE
               You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the 
               sidewalk.  And into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do 
               it!  I'll testify!

                               EDDIE

     Tate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, here's what I want.  I know about 
               this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With 
               room service.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Hawaii.

               Diamond Head.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a 
               disguise.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Armani.

                               CLARKSON
               No -- Calvin Klein.

                               CHRISTY
               For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my 
               hair -- up?

                               CLARKSON
               It could work.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, what do you think this is --
               Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out 
               for you.  You have to hide like you don't 
               even exist.  You have to get so far 
               hidden away that you never see sunlight.

                               CHRISTY
                             (confused)
               Okay -- no limo.

                               EDDIE
               No nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               What're you gonna do, put me in a bag 
               and bury me?

                               EDDIE
               I'm gonna put you in the last place on 
               Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

     Eddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at 
     all a

     INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY

     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, 
     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- 
     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.

     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't 
     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER 
     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because 
     Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's 
     playing.

     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she 
     closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front 
     door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Eddie)
               I hate you.  I totally hate you.

                               EDDIE
               Safest place in the world.  You think 
               Vince would look for you here?

     As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious 
     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. 
     ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of 
     hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait 
     of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders.

                               CHRISTY
               Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. 
               Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.

                               EDDIE
               It's a convent.  All you have to do is 
               shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

                               CHRISTY
               With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm 
               gonna go back, work things out with 
               Vince.

     Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie 
     catches her arm.

                               EDDIE
               Vince has put out a contract on you.  A 
               hundred grand.  You've seen him in 
               action.

     Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's 
     telling the truth.

                               CHRISTY
               But... but Vince loves me.  How could 
               he... I mean, five years...

     Page 20.

                               EDDIE
               And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna 
               take.

                               CHRISTY
                             (suddenly scared)
               But Vince has contacts all over the 
               place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll 
               be looking for me!

                               EDDIE
               Everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
               wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here 
               but me.  We're trying to get a quick 
               court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. 
               I'll spring you as soon as I can.

                               CHRISTY
                             (panicking)
               I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! 
               Eddie, what am I gonna do?

                               EDDIE
               Pray.
                             (smiling)

     From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn --
     horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are 
     real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges 
     her into a corridor, and she follows.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the 
     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and 
     wimple.

     Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the 
     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's 
     a world she controls.

               But Mother Superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE 
               O'HARA stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but 
               no.

                               O'HARA
               We can save this young woman's life, and 
               imprison a parasite -- all in one 
               gesture.

     Page 21.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But she's been exposed to the underside 
               of life.  She is the underside of life.

                               O'HARA
               And therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely 
               there are... more appropriate shelters.

                               O'HARA
               Your small convent is in danger of 
               closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas 
               Police Department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop...

                               O'HARA
               St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. 
               You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To 
               all in need.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I lied.

                               O'HARA
               I know.
                             (smiling)

     Mother Superior's jaw locks.  She realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can.  There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy 
     enter.

                               O'HARA
               Welcome, Lieutenant.  Everything is in 
               order.

                               EDDIE
               Aces.  Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, 
               down at the corner?

     The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior 
     panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's 
     office.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, you're not leaving me alone...

                               O'HARA
                             (reassuringly)
               You're never alone in this house, my 
               child.

     Eddie touches her gently on the arm.

     Page 22.

                               EDDIE
               One month, two tops.  Behave yourself.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Bishop...
                             (a last-ditch attempt)

                               O'HARA
                             (opening the door to 
                             leave)
               Lieutenant?

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER

     Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's 
     front door.  As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing 
     horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

                               CHRISTY
               A convent?  They put me in a convent? 
               What's the problem?  Wasn't there any 
               more room in Hell?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very calm)
               What is your full name?  Your Christian 
               name?

                               CHRISTY
               Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you 
               understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm 
               the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm 
               being punished!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your name?

                               CHRISTY
               Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Enough joking.

                               CHRISTY
               That's my real name!  Currently I'm a  
               singer.  Sort of.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell 
               me this isn't happening.  It's a 
               nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!

     Page 23.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               St. Anne's?

                               CHRISTY
               Parochial school.  Akron.  St. 
               Android's.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You were unhappy?

                               CHRISTY
               I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The reason?

                               CHRISTY
               Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! 
               Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy 
               petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing 
               a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon 
               bra.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I see.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  You see?  I have to get out of 
               here   I have to make a phone call.  
               Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent!  
               You're a nun!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very stern)
               Sit down.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mother Superior rises.  She is an extremely imposing 
     woman. 

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sit.

     Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother 
     Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Miss Van Cartier. 

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (belligerent)

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cigarette -- out.

     Christy inspects her cigarette.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (ruefully)
               It has come to pass.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago.  At that time, the world knew some 
               measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality, to families, 
               to children, to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise.  And, as the years have 
               passed, I have watched that promise 
               destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.
                             (staring at Christy's 
                             outfit) Spandex.  And. 
                             so I have made this 
                             convent an oasis, a 
                             retreat from horror. 
                             And now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls.

                               CHRISTY
               Are you talking about me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And all those like you.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean black people?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The 
               heedless.  And their Las Vegas 
               concubines.

                               CHRISTY
                             (very suspicious) 
                             What's a concubine?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Check your driver's license.

     Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, 
               I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here 
               or I'm target practice.  So here's the 
               deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug 
               me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch 
               some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just 
               get me a key and show me to my room, and 
               do not disturb.  Capisce?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (suspiciously 
                             gracious)
               Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

     Page 25.

                               CHRISTY
               Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Before we do, you might like to freshen 
               up.  And you'll certainly want to change

                               CHRISTY
                             (sniffing her clothes, 
                             the same outfit she's 
                             had on since the night 
                             at Vince's office)
               Deal.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, 
     and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a 
     corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the 
     screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior 
     stands beside the screen, catching the various items of 
     clothing which Christy tosses to her.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               How about a robe?  One of those big 
               terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on 
               the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Would you like that?

     Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and 
     tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR."

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               You should hand-wash that blouse, and 
               send somebody out for some things.  I 
               look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
               and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me 
               pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my 
               mouth.

     Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a 
     ruler; it goes down the incinerator.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. 
               You will find appropriate attire.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               Can do.

     INT. CHAPEL

     A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear 
     a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look 
     up, puzzled.

     Page 26.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring 
     at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and 
     wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the 
     wimple.

                               CHRISTY
                             (almost unable to 
                             speak)
               No!  No!  I can't do this!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, 
               and you endanger us all.  While you are 
               here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.  
               Only I shall know who, and what, you 
               truly are.  You will not disrupt the 
               convent.  You will not influence the 
               Sisters with your colorful street talk. 
               You will draw no attention to yourself in 
               any way.

                               CHRISTY
                             (furious, in 
                             disbelief)
               But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a 
               nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As of now, and until you leave, you are 
               Sister Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
                             (outraged)
               Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb 
               guy?

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is 
     beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The Mary is in deference to the Holy 
               Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint 
               Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows 
               that every nun must accept.  The vow of 
               poverty...

                               CHRISTY
                             (pulling out her 
                             pockets)
               No problem.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The vow of obedience.

                               CHRISTY
               Like to who?

     Page 27.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And the vow of chastity.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm outta here.

     Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the 
     wimple

     INT. CONVENT DINING HALL

     A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier.  There is a long, central wooden 
     table, with rough wooden benches.

     The convent's population is standing around the table in 
     silence.  There are about thirty nuns in all.

     Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with 
     Christy following her.  She motions for Christy to stand at 
     her right.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good afternoon, Sisters.  I apologize 
               for my tardiness.  I would like you to 
               welcome a new member of our order, Sister 
               Mary Clarence.

     ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside 
     Christy.  Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but 
     very sweet.  She has only been at the convent a few years; 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  She sneaks a look 
     at Christy.  Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent.  She 
               is eager for a more disciplined life, and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways.

     Everyone sits, including Christy.  SISTER MARY PATRICK, a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary 
     Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes, Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Reverend Mother, on behalf of the 
               sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary 
               Clarence to St. Katherine's.

     ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. 

     Page 28.

                               MARY PATRICK
               As part of our welcome, I've had a 
               little thought, just for fun.  Could we 
               have our new friend offer today's 
               blessing?

     ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (reluctantly)
               Very well.  Mary Clarence, rise please.

     Christy stands up slowly, aghast.

                               CHRISTY
               A blessing?  Like, for lunch?

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming.  She and the other nuns 
     bow their heads.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to recall a 
                             blessing)
               For what we are about to receive...

     So far, so good.  Mother Superior has one eye open.

                               CHRISTY
               may the Lord... prepare us and... watch 
               us and... walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and... to the republic for 
               which it stands... God bless us every 
               one, hallowed be thy name.  Hallelujah.  
               Ave Maria. Boyardee.  Amen.

     ANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior 
     rises, very quickly.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sisters, for the rest of the day we 
               shall declare a Vow of Silence.

                               CHRISTY
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Surely you are familiar with this 
               practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our 
               lips are silent, can our prayers truly be 
               heard.

                               CHRISTY
               Silence?  No talking?  All day?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Until sundown.

     Page 29.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words. 
                             without speaking aloud)
               Oh my God.

     Christy reaches for a piece of bread.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Mary Clarence?

     Christy looks up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As a new member of our order, I think 
               you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words)
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of 
               those who must endure without enough to 
               eat.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing)
               No food?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (taking away Christy's 
                             plate)
               No food.  Not until sundown.

     ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching 
     the other nuns eat.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey 
     and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.  Vince is 
     steaming as they walk through the parking lot.

                               VINCE
               They grilled me for six hours in there. 
               And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell 
               were you?

                               LARRY
               It takes time, Vince.  Slow and steady. 
               We've been through this before.

     Vince reaches his car.  As Joey opens the door for him, 
     another car drives by, and stops.  Eddie is driving; he 
     leans out the window.

                               EDDIE
               So long, Vince.  See you soon.

     Page 30.

     Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.  Eddie 
     drives off, chuckling.

                               VINCE
               He's so damn cocky.  This is different.

                               JOEY
               It's a bluff, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You know so much.  They've got Christy, 
               and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, 
               from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to 
               every contact we got.

     Larry covers his ears with both hands.

                               LARRY
               I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, 
               Vince, and you're just an honest casino 
               owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent 
               victim.

                               VINCE
               Keep the message vague, but let 'em 
               know.  The price has gone up.  Christy 
               Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.  
               Dead or nearby.

     Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.

     EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY

     The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.

     Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. 
     They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.

     Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is 
     hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot.  
     She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks 
     up.

     Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, 
     breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, 
     as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over.

     Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.  
     Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their 
     tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister 
     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger 
     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.

     Page 31.

     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes 
     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.

     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn 
     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles 
     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.

     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees 
     Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother 
     Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.

     EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT

     LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of 
     Silence.

     We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

     This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors 
     with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the 
     nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing 
     their doors for the night.

     Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, 
     bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this all the food I get?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes.  Until breakfast.

                               CHRISTY
               That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any 
               snacks?  Machines?

     They stop by a door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               My what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cell.  Your room.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy 
     enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There 
     is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered 
     mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

     Page 32.

                               CHRISTY
                             (looking around)
               You were right the first time.  Is this 
               like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the 
               furniture?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Our lives are simple.  We have little 
               need for material possessions.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure thing.  But what about, 
               like, appliances?  Like a little color 
               portable?  Boom box?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Useless distractions.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sinking to the bed)
               It's like the Stone Age.  The room time 
               forgot.  What about a phone?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And whom would you call?

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, I don't know... Satan?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused) 
               Your cell is more than adequate.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping-
               Pong?  Row over to the monastery?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.

                               CHRISTY
               Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? 
               At nine?  My day's just starting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use 
               this time, to think about my life.  And 
               its direction.  Or lack thereof.

                               CHRISTY
                             (indignant)
               What's wrong with my life?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               From all I've heard, just about 
               everything.  Your singing career seems 
               all but nonexistent, and your married 
               lover wants you dead.

     Page 33

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               If you're fooling anyone, it's only 
               yourself.  God has brought you here. Take 
               the hint.

     Mother Superior leaves.

     After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one 
     small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the 
     wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother 
     Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become 
     overwhelms her.  She fights back tears.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     Christy is fast asleep.  There is a RAPPING at the door.

                               MARY ROBERT (0.S.)
               Sister Mary Clarence!

     EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY

     All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and 
     nightshirts, down the hallway.

     Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and 
     her hair is a mess.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Come on, we're late.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What time is it?

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's after five.  We have to bathe.

                               CHRISTY
                             (groaning)
               Five a.m.?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with 
     several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  They 
     carry soap and towels.

     Page 34.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (sincerely)
               Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good 
               morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Is this like your old convent?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Which convent was that, Sister?

                               CHRISTY
               Which convent?  It was, um, the Little 
               Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. 
               Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. 
               Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside. 

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Enough jabber.

     MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, 
     a hard-liner.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It 
               sounds awful.  It sounds just like this 
               place.

                               CHRISTY
               Like this place?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out 
               in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like 
               here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare 
               feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on 
               earth, but I loved it.  This place is a 
               Hilton.

     INT. BATHING ROOM

     A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is 
     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads 
     and shoulders.

     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, 
     her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing 
     softly to herself.

     Page 35.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE

                               A FEW OTHER NUNS
                             (very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

     Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  The 
     other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  There is no sign 
     of singing.  Christy decides to try a test.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
                             (still very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

                               CHRISTY
               IF I WERE YOU,
               I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK

     The nuns giggle.

                               CHRISTY
               Where did that come from?

                               MARY PATRICK
               I haven't heard that song in ages.  The 
               Ronettes?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (very grouchy)
               Shirelles.

                               CHRISTY
               You know that song?

                               MARY PATRICK
               1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when 
               many of us took final vows.  It's the 
               last secular music we recall.

                               CHRISTY
               No.
               HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING
               NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING

                               ALL THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY LA

     Page 36.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (cutting off the song)
               That's enough.  We've got to get to 
               chapel.

     Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around.

                               CHRISTY
               Anybody got conditioner?

     INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in 
     the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to 
     his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother 
     Superior, sit in the first few pews.

                               O'HARA
               We are a small congregation this 
               morning.  Too many mornings.  Something 
               has gone terribly wrong.   Where is 
               faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is 
               everyone?  Still, rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present.  Our 
               choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has 
               informed me that our choir, while always 
               superior, has been toiling especially 
               hard on this week's selection.  Sister?

     Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins 
     singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be 
     Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no 
     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.

     As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. 
     Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance.

     ANGLE ON CHRISTY

     sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall 
     asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday 
     School calendar.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT

     Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into 
     the police station.

     INT. POLICE STATION

     Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled 
     office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow 
     him.

     Page 37.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter.

                               CLARKSON
               There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. 
               this morning.  The place was fencing 
               stolen property.  They found this.

     Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity 
     photograph of Christy.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a 
               wonderful world.
                             (reading the fax 
                             sheet) 
               Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two 
               hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
               Please find our adored angel, we miss her 
               so.  Dead or alive.

                               TATE
               Vince is getting desperate.  Where is 
               she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?

                               EDDIE
               Where's who?

                               TATE
               You won't even tell us?

                               EDDIE
               I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

     INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style 
     desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has 
     gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and 
     clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad 
     Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her 
     usual perky manner.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Good afternoon, young ladies.  And 
               welcome to our Christian Youth Group.

     The Girls make grunting noises.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and 
               maybe learn a little something, too. Now, 
               today's topic is something very up-to-
               date -- "Teenage Promiscuity."  My. Now, 
               can anyone tell me -- just what is 
               promiscuity?

     ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their 
     eyes.

     Page 38

                               MARY PATRICK
               Anyone?  Yes?

     Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier 
     and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda.

                               LAWANDA
               Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A 
               whole lot.  Till your head falls off.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (blushing)
               Well, yes.  That is one way to put it.

     Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by 
     Christy

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sister Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Yes?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I need to see you, at once.  Girls, 
               please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a 
               few moments.  Mary Clarence?

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. 
               She'll be minding you until Sister Mary 
               Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please 
               assign a biblical passage.  Do not 
               attempt discussion.  Am I understood?

                               CHRISTY
               I got it.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (to Mary Patrick)
               Come, Sister.

     Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. 
     Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is 
     visibly uncomfortable.

                               CHRISTY
               So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary 
               Clarence.  And you're... young 
               Christians.  I guess I should assign you 
               this passage.  What's good?  What were 
               you talking about?

                               LAWANDA
               We were talking about the wild thing. 
               Teen promiscuity.

                               CHRISTY
                             (after a beat)
               Really.

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing 
               it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to behave)
               Well... yes.  Yes it is.

                               LAWANDA
                             (goading Christy)
               How come?  Sister?

                               CHRISTY
                             (still trying to 
                             behave)
               Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou 
               shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.

     The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- just what are you all doing 
               here?  At Sunday School?

                               LAWANDA
               'Cause we love it so damn much.  And 
               cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

                               CHRISTY
               Probation?

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. 
               Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch 
               with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So 
               we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll 
               learn valuable lessons.  And I learned 
               mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will 
               never rip out nobody's nose-ring by 
               accident ever again.  Can I go now?

                               CHRISTY
                             (getting fed up)
               Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can 
               tell.

                               LAWANDA
               Well, what would you know about it, 
               anyway?  What do any of you nunheads know 
               about anything?  About doin' the nasty, 
               or gettin' high?

                               CONCHITA
               Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just 
               some ol' nun!  Don't pick on no nun, it's 
               bad luck!

     Page 40.

                               CHRISTY
                             (fed up)
               Shut up!

     All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want 
               to ask me something?  You want to listen, 
               for once in your little lives? You want 
               to pay some attention?

                               CHARLENE
               What about crack?  You a user?

                               CHRISTY
               I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

     All the girls jeer at Charlene.

                               KESHIA
               Got you, Charlene!

                               CONCHITA
               Dunked by the nun!

                               LAWANDA
                             (more sincerely)
               Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if 
               some dude is after you, and he's always 
               saying stuff, commin' on sweet and 
               mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll 
               love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, 
               you'd stay.

                               CHRISTY
               And you listen to that?

                               LAWANDA
               No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I 
               do.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               What you do?

                               CHRISTY
               Just tell him, I do love you, but I 
               can't -- I'm a nun.

     The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like 
     Christy.

     Page 41.

                               CHARLENE
               But, like what if you are doin' it? What 
               about protection?  Who's responsible?

                               CONCHITA
               What about them things, you know, for 
               the guy?  Aren't they like, a mess to put 
               on?  Don't they kinda mess up the mood?

                               CHRISTY
               Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's 
               important, nowadays.  You just practice 
               at home, with a balloon and a banana.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)
               Mary Clarence!

     Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick.  Everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has 
     noticed their entrance.

                               CHRISTY
                             (thinking on her feet)
               Because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast.  And don't forget fiber.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

     Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very 
     angry.  Christy sits across from her.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary 
               Clarence, what were you thinking?

                               CHRISTY
               Those girls were asking questions.  
               They've got it rough.  I wish somebody 
               had talked to me about that stuff when 
               was their age.  I wish somebody would 
               talk to me about it now.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This is a convent, not a clinic.  We 
               offer moral guidance, not hardware.

                               CHRISTY
               Have you been out in those streets?  Do 
               you know what those kids are up against?  
               You should help them!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We are nuns.  We seek solutions through 
               prayer.

     Page 42.

                               CHRISTY
               Sometimes it's not enough!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone 
               cannot help a situation.  Such as your 
               own, for example.  How do you feel about 
               physical labor?

                               CHRISTY
               It never solves anything.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, 
               in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a 
               wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy 
               task, and know ye the path of 
               contentment."

                               CHRISTY
               In English?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary 
               Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."

     Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight 
     Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two.

                               VINCE
                             (very seductive)
               Baby, you know I do... of course... I 
               feel it too... I'm blushing... can you 
               hold?

     A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince 
     meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved 
     in a second romantic call.

                               VINCE
               Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... 
               how lonely?

                               WILLY
               It's that call you were expecting, 
               Vince.

                               VINCE
               Can you hold?  Can you try?

     Willy passes the phone to Vince. t

     Page 43

                               VINCE
               Have you found out where Christy is yet?  
               Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want 
               to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find 
               her, and find her now!

     Vince passes the phone back to Willy.

                               VINCE
               Raise the ante to three hundred grand.

     Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his 
     composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.

                               VINCE
               Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a 
               stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... 
               inside...

     INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM

     This is a large, open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself.  
     Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting 
     Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.

     On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing 
     loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a 
     tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the 
     loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands 
     beside her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               The minute I saw you. I said to myself, 
               she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a 
               loom?

                               CHRISTY
               Not in years.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Well, it all comes back, in just a 
               jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of 
               the convent.

                               CHRISTY
               Why?

                               MARY PATRICK
               To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, 
               but we're in terrible trouble here at St. 
               Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the 
               furnace is going, and there's no money.

                               CHRISTY
               But don't you get money?  From the 
               Vatican?

     Page 44.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely 
               self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like 
               yours.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, right.  At my old place, we used 
               to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice 
               loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, 
               and then you can hop right in.
                             (as she deftly works 
                             the loom)
               You just draw your beater in, keep it 
               pressed against the pick, and open the 
               shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and 
               open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, 
               shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the 
               warp.  Is that clear?

                               CHRISTY
                             (pretending to be 
                             fascinated)
               Just about.  Show me again.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You betcha.

     CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed 
     considerably.

     ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing 
     through a magazine.

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your 
               heddles.

                               CHRISTY
               I love my heddles.  Show me again.

     Mother Superior appears.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving 
               progressing?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend 
               Mother -

     Page 45.

                               CHRISTY
               Really catching on.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the 
               office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

     Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the 
     loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.

     Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her 
     face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's 
     instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were 
     about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, 
     at random.  She moves these parts.

     ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, 
     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, 
     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. 
     Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Months of work, and the loom, absolutely 
               ruined!

                               CHRISTY
               Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I 
               wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, 
               or knit little sweaters! I don't do that!  
               I'm a star!

     Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and 
     stares at Christy.  Then she smiles, in a rather 
     frightening manner.

     MONTAGE - CHRISTY

     A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway.

     B)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag.

     C)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel.  She discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters.

     Page 46

     D)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  The CAMERA 
     PULLS BACK.  Christy is sitting in a small stone room, 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other 
     mending.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  She keeps 
     checking the door, to make sure no one is listening.

                               CHRISTY
                             (into phone)
               Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.  
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Mulcahy.

     Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically.  INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.

                               EDDIE
               Not again.  You can't keep calling. 
               Somebody's going to catch on to where you 
               are.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm going insane!  All these people 
               do is pray and work, work and pray!  I 
               don't get it -- when's the weekend? They 
               have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call 
               food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns!  
               I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray 
               five times a days  Do you know what I 
               pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea?  
               Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall 
               off yet?  Get me outta her!

                               EDDIE
               Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell 
               you this, but we've had some problems 
               with our protection program lately.

                               CHRISTY
               Like what?

                               EDDIE
               Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide 
               them, but there's a leak in the 
               department, and they end up dead.

                               CHRISTY
               You son-of-a-bitch!

     Page 47

                               EDDIE
               I just need a few more weeks,

                               CHRISTY
               But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior 
               is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

     In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they 
     sound even worse than usual.

                               CHRISTY
                             (holding the phone 
                             out)
               Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, 
               in here, that's what they call music!

                               EDDIE
               Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll 
               be in touch.

     As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters.  Christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She 
     sings as she works.

                               CHRISTY
               THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF 
               MUSIC...

     Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room.  Mother 
     Superior looks mystified.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT

     Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, 
     utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  There is a 
     meek SCRATCHING at her door.

                               CHRISTY
                             (without moving)
               Yeah?

     Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly.  She barely looks 
     up.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What does she want now?  I did 
               the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted 
               the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why 
               can't people share?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (not speaking above a 
                             whisper)
               I... I...

     Page 48.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY ROBERT
               I... I brought you something.

                               CHRISTY
               A cigarette?

                               MARY ROBERT
               An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, 
               you need your strength.  You've been 
               working so hard.

     Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread.  Christy takes it..

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister 
               Bruce?  Sister Doug?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (until almost 
                             whispering)
               Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.

     Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  She 
     doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a 
     loss.

                               CHRISTY
               So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. 
               K's?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Three years.  Sister.

                               CHRISTY
               Three years.  A rookie.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A novice.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? 
               When do you hit the big time?  You know, 
               when do you take the final vows?

     Mary Robert bursts into tears.

                               CHRISTY
               Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? 
               What'd I say?

     Page 49.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (still sobbing)
               You have to help me

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are 
               they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they 
               drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, 
               kidnap your parents?  We can call the 
               Enquirer.

                               MARY ROBERT
               No, you don't understand -- I don't want 
               to get out!  I want to get in?

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I 
               want to take my final vows, I would do it 
               tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let 
               me!

                               CHRISTY
               She won't?  Why not?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She says I should wait.  She says that 
               no one should become a nun as an escape 
               from life.  She says that I'm not 
               experienced enough to make the decision 
               yet.  In a mature manner.

                               CHRISTY
               She said that?  Reverend Mother?

     Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets 
     outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, 
     and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, then there's only one thing to do.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother says you need 
               experience, right, in life.  In order to 
               make a responsible decision.  This is 
               going to be very painful for me.  You 
               know how much I love this little room. 
               This whole convent.  Wait.

     Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the 
     wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus 
     is advising her.

     Page 50.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please 
               help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my 
               selfish cares aside... I must think of 
               others... yes, she's here...
                             (she gestures to Mary 
                             Robert)
               He says hi... yes, I understand... let 
               thy will be done.  Amen.  You too.

     Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy 
     message.

                               CHRISTY
               We must do this sacred thing, Mary 
               Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (desperate)
               Of course!  We must do it!  It's the 
               will of God!  What is it?

                               CHRISTY
                             (shutting her eyes, 
                             for the full spiritual 
                             effect)
               We must... get you some experience.  We 
               must... leave this place.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Are you sure?

     Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to 
     the crucifix.  She gets confirmation.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               We hear you.

     EXT. STREET

     The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and 
     Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and 
     steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears 
     from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy 
     pulls her along.

     EXT. A STREET NEARBY

     Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks 
     from the convent.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (looking around 
                             cautiously)
               Are you sure this is what Reverend 
               Mother had in mind?

     Page 51.

                               CHRISTY
               I know it is.  It's life.  Experience.  
               Take a deep breath.

     Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She 
     spins, letting her habit billow around her.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (shocked)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
               Now you.

     Mary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- "Me?" 
     Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, 
     and does a little, timid hop.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a start.

     EXT. SOCIAL CLUB

     A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer 
     signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all 
     but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge 
     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the 
     teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth 
     group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group 
     falls silent.

                               CHRISTY
               How are you doing.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?

                               CHRISTY
               You know it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We need experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (remembering she's a 
                             nun)
               It's part of St. Katherine's new 
               community outreach program.  How old are 
               you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you 
               ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em 
               over.

     Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy 
     turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.

     Page 52.

                               CHRISTY
               And you, with the devil's brew passing 
               through your lips.
                             (holding out her hand)
               A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

     The boy hands over the beer.  Christy and Mary Robert 
     enter the club.

     INT. SOCIAL CLUB

     Christy enters the club and grins.  She takes a drag on 
     the cigarette.  Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's 
     hand, and takes a swig.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked)
               Bobs

                               MARY ROBERT
               Experience!  Right?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

     The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, 
     couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor 
     is packed.  The atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all 
     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts 
     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the 
     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.

                               CHRISTY
               A couple of bowls of chili.
                             (holding up the beer)
               And another round of these.

     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club 
     has never hosted nuns before.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the waitress, 
                             confidentially)
               I have to do this.  So I can become a 
               nun.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, 
               we make her wear her underwear on her 
               head.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Really?

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               And she wants to be a nun.

     The waitress leaves, shaking her head.  Christy and Mary 
     Robert watch the action at the club.

     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, 
     especially Christy; he tries to place her.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Who are all these people?

                               CHRISTY
               This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. 
               You should get to know 'em.

     From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to 
     study Christy's face.  He takes out a copy of Vince's fax 
     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy's hair in the 
     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no 
     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.

     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the 
     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club 
     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy 
     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the 
     music.

     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns 
     table.  He is clearly amused at their presence.

                               DUDE
               Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Better now.

                               DUDE
               How come they let you out?  Out of that 
               convent place?

                               CHRISTY
               Time off.  For bad behavior.

                               DUDE
               Oww!  A nun havin' fun!  I don't believe 
               it!  It's good to have you ladies in this 
               fine establishment.  So... anybody on the 
               move?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (standing up)
               I am.

     Page 54.

                               CHRISTY
               Bob!  What're you doing?

     Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'm getting experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Dude)
               You watch yourself!

     Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; 
     she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.

     As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance;  
     Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves.  
     The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down.

                               CLUB PATRON #1
               Do it, Sisters!

                               CLUB PATRON #2
               Sway and pray!

     As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the 
     Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent. 
     They are both in very good spirits.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Those people are wonderful!  Why don't 
               we ever see them in church?

                               CHRISTY
               Good point.  Especially that dude you 
               were with.  I'd like to see him down 
               front.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (giggling)
               Mary Clarence!  You're so... different 
               from the other sisters.  Sometimes, 
               well... sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson.

                               CHRISTY
               Honey.

     As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car 
     that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out.

     Page 55.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother 
               about all my experiences.  I've learned 
               so much.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, you know, you don't have to tell 
               her everything.  I mean, nothing really 
               happened.  We just... took a walk.

     The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns 
     turn, startled.  The car hurtles toward them.  They scream, 
     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the 
     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.

     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into 
     reverse, and then pull forward again.  She sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the 
     bartender) leans out the window.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mary Robert)
               Run!

     Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does 
     so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the 
     two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them.

     EXT. ALLEY

     Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's 
     FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence! 

                               CHRISTY
               Keep moving!

     Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary 
     Robert up the ladder ahead of her.

                               CHRISTY
               Climb!  Now!

     As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another 
     GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire 
     escape.

     The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but 
     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground.

     At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in 
     the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces.

     Page 56.

                               CHRISTY
               Goddamn it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence!

     Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING 
     down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves 
     Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and 
     follows her in.

     INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT

     Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an 
     Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in 
     bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned 
     to see two nuns in their bedroom.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my Lord!

                               CHRISTY
                             (pushing Mary Robert 
                             forward)
               Experience!

     The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out 
     of the room.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the 
     convent; they catch their breath.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What was all that?  Who was that man?  
               Why would he shoot at us?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know, some people just don't 
               like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We could have been killed!  But you 
               saved me!
                             (throwing her arms 
                             around Christy)
               Thank you, Mary Clarence!

     The door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is 
     waiting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes -- thank you so much.

     Page 57

     INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, 
     listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She 
     seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the 
     principal's office.

     The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.

                               CHRISTY
               What'd she say?

                               EDDIE
               You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't 
               want you back.

                               CHRISTY
               Does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there?

                               EDDIE
               She's counting on it.  She's concerned 
               for your safety, but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you. Or a carnival.

                               CHRISTY
               So what am I supposed to do in the 
               meantime?

                               EDDIE
               Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. 
                             (urging her)
               Go.

     Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She 
     looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally 
     does.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy.

                               CHRISTY
               So... hi there.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused and not 
                             looking up)
               I don't believe we have anything to say 
               to each other.

                               CHRISTY
               Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm 
               incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I 
               wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would 
               happen!

     Page 58.

     Mother Superior glances up from her work.  She is 
     justifiably outraged.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your 
               behavior was inexcusable!

                               CHRISTY
               I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for 
               it to happen!  And I was the one they 
               were shooting at!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, I have given you every 
               opportunity.  To change.  To make a 
               decent life for yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A 
               janitor?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Clearly, you have learned nothing. And 
               you present an ongoing threat, both to 
               this convent and to yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to 
               kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! 
               Aren't you supposed to have compassion? 
               For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a 
               major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of 
               Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come 
               true?  Your Olympic event?

     Mother Superior stares at Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.

                               CHRISTY
                             (surprised)
               I am?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You may stay.  But I shall restrict your 
               activities to but a single task.

                               CHRISTY
                             (with great dread)
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have, I believe, some minimal 
               background in music.  Therefore, you are 
               to join our choir.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You will sing, and you will sleep,' that 
               is your schedule until you depart.  As 
               almost no one attends Mass, you will be 
               unable to cause further damage.

                               CHRISTY
               No.  No.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (smiling)
               You're my Olympic event.

                               CHRISTY
               Not the choir, please, anything but 
               that.  The choir -- I mean, have you 
               heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub 
               floors, toilets, you name it, but not 
               that I

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (in triumph)
               The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the 
               gold.

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - THAT DAY

     There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. 
     Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary 
     Robert are also in the choir.  Christy appears at the door, 
     grimacing.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this... choir practice?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

     Christy spots Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last 
               night...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me.  
               You were only trying to help, to give me 
               experience.  I tried to explain that to 
               Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if 
               she understood.

     Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at 
     Christy.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Soprano or alto?

                               CHRISTY
                             (very gloomy)
               Whatever.

     Page 60.

     Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. 
     The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother 
     trying.  She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding 
     group in history.  They seem to be singing in several 
     random keys, and they even have trouble with the words.  No 
     one looks up from their hymnals.  Sister Alma, the organist 
     with the hearing aid, is plodding along.

     INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - DAY

     Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting 
     them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter.

                               JOEY
               We're looking for Mike.

                               MIKE
               You found him -- but we're not open yet.

     Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back.

                               MIKE
               Hey -- the till's empty!

     Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him.  Joey 
     lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.

                               JOEY
               I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into 
               him.

                               MIKE
               Who are you guys?

                               JOEY
               We're the guys from Vegas.  You had 
               Christy last night, but you let her get 
               away.  It's upsetting.

     Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again.

                               MIKE
               But you didn't tell me!

                               JOEY
               We didn't tell you what?

                               MIKE
               That she's a nun!  That chick you're 
               looking for -- she's a nun!

                               WILLY
               What?  Christy?

     Page 61.

                               JOEY
               A nun?

                               MIKE
               I'm telling you!

     Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this.  
     Then they burst out laughing.  They refuse to believe 
     Mike's story.

                               WILLY
               Gimme a hand here.

     Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar. 
     Then they exit, still laughing.

                               JOEY
               A nun!

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn 
     Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she 
     is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of 
     the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Mary Clarence, are you with us?

                               CHRISTY
               Um, I don't really know this one...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence has a background in music. 
               That's what Reverend Mother said.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (eagerly)
               Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a 
               choirmistress?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (circling Christy)
               Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I 
               don't see?  You think I took vows 
               yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You 
               and Reverend Mother.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               You're a ringer.  She brought you in to 
               replace me.  Out with the old.

     Page 62.

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, 
               you're terrific, but...
                             (to Christy)
               Could you help us?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               Please?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               You've heard us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Well.

     Everyone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the 
     room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               There's a word for this -- mutiny.
                             (to Christy)
               So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do 
               better.  I believe I'd like to see that.
                             (she hands Christy her 
                             pitchpipe and baton)
               I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue 
               factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em 
               sing.

     Everyone watches Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               Well...
                             (to Nary Lazarus)
               With all due respect... let's have a 
               look at this.

     Christy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet 
     music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided."  She sits at the 
     piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano, accompanying herself.

                               CHRISTY
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She 
     stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she 
     has really heard herself.

                               CHRISTY
               Man.  I sound like you guys.

     Page 63.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (victorious)
               Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our 
               lesson?  I won't hold this little episode 
               against anyone.  I'll try not to.

                               CHRISTY
                             (standing)
               Mary Robert.

     Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. 

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You 
               never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing 
               comes out.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't want to mess anyone up...

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Sister Alma)
               Give me a C.
                             (because Sister Alma 
                             is hard of hearing)
               A C!

     Sister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at 
     Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note.

                               CHRISTY
               Louder!  Like you're onstage.

     Mary Robert sings a little louder.

                               CHRISTY
               Like people are eating, and there's 
               silverware, and you want them to hear 
               you.

     Mary Robert sings louder still.

                               CHRISTY
               Think about that guy you were dancing 
               with!

     Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge 
     and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she 
     stops abruptly; she has scared herself.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my!

     Page 64.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  We've got the voices.  They're 
               just allover the place. I've heard all of 
               you, in the shower --you're decent.  
               Better than me.  We just need charts -- 
               harmony -- chops.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (puzzled)
               Chops?

                               CHRISTY
               The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's 
               rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, 
               you re not a natural soprano, you're an 
               alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with 
               the sopranos.

     The two nuns trade places.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma -- a C.

     Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy 
     uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving 
     each her note, urging them closer to pitch.

                               CHRISTY
               Middle section, hold that note, for dear 
               life.  Sopranos, an A.  Sister Alma?

     Sister Alma hits the note.  Christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going 
     with the altos, using her pitchpipe.

     For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord.  They are elated.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We did it!  We actually sang a chord!

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (thrilled and 
                             disconcerted)
               That was exciting!

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, for one second.  That was the 
               blend -- you've got to listen to each 
               other.  Be a group.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (under her breath)
               I knew that.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you 
               like discipline.  Hard work.

     Page 65.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now.  
               The Lord hates a loafer.

                               CHRISTY
               I hear you.  How many days a week do you 
               rehearse?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Two days.  An hour or so.

                               CHRISTY
               No way.  We're a choir, right? 
               Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a 
               week won't cut it.  Every day.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (impressed)
               She's good.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to Christy)
               Do you really think we could do it?  Get 
               better?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you 
               think?  They're pretty raw.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Wet behind the ears.

                               CHRISTY
               A bunch of real mama's girls.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, please?  Can't we try?

     Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real 
     comrades.  Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.

                               CHRISTY
               It'll be hell.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tell me about it.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly.  Christy 
     turns to the choir, very businesslike.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten-hut!

     INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     This is a basement utility room.     A large industrial 
     washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a 
     repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound

     Page 66.

     The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others 
     fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long 
     table.  Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet.  
     Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the 
     washer-dryer.

                               CHRISTY
               That machine.

                               MARY PATRICK
               I know.  It's ancient.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a rhythm section.  The beat.

     Christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the 
     washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Patrick -- do you remember the 
               Dixie Cups?

                               MARY PATRICK
               The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a 
               girl.  Of course.
                             (singing)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE

                               CHRISTY
                             (stopping the beat)
               Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty 
               cheerful person, aren't you?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Am I?

     There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (as a confession)
               All right, I am, I know it!  All my 
               life, I've just been... upbeat. 
               Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. 
               Even when I was little, I remember my 
               mother used to say, "That child is pure 
               sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a 
               stewardess."

                               CHRISTY
               So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're 
               usually about rejoicing, right? 
               Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't 
               hold back.  Let all that joy go right 
               into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me 
               hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (with real joy)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE
               I'LL BE HIS
               AND HE'LL BE MINE
               WE'LL LOVE UNTIL
